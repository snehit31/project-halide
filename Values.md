Values-"Inspired by you, the community, through your actions and stories."

a)Everyone is welcome! Participants in Hacktoberfest represented 151 countries and thousands of unique skill sets. 
This program welcomes everyone already whoâ€™s already part of the open source software community, and anyone who is interested in sectioning in.

b)Quantity is fun, quality is key. 
Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building.
However, it all begins with meaningful contributions to open source software.

c)Short-term action, long-term impact. In the open source software community, we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. 
Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long after October. This is a voyage not a race.
